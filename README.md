# Templates
Created this repo as a means of testing out how to use Github as a tool to for managing, tracking, and automating project documentation.
The general idea is to reduce toil by building a template folder structure with boilerplate project documents / templates that already have links to each other and relative data tables so this doesn't have t be recreated from scratch for each project.
